# 2-bit-Branch-Predictor-in-Verilog
This project implements a 2-bit branch predictor in Verilog. Branch prediction is a technique used in CPU instruction pipelines to guess the outcome of a conditional branch instruction to avoid pipeline stalls. The 2-bit predictor uses a saturating counter to improve prediction accuracy.
